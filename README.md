# 🤖 WPI CS539 – Machine Learning

This repository contains my **coursework projects and assignments** for the graduate-level course  
**CS539: Machine Learning** at **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)**.  
It demonstrates practical experience in building and evaluating supervised learning models for real-world data applications.

## 🧠 Course Focus
> *Supervised learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive analytics.*

### Key Project
**Predicting Baldness Risk and Hair Loss Severity Using Machine Learning** —  
applied regression and classification models to analyze a real-world dataset of 7,900 individuals.  
The project aimed to predict both the **probability of developing baldness** and the **severity of future hair loss** based on demographic, genetic, lifestyle, and psychological attributes.

### Highlights
- Built and compared multiple ML models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Ridge/Lasso Regression**, and **XGBoost**.  
- Conducted **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering** (missing-value handling, normalization, categorical encoding).  
- Evaluated models via cross-validation using metrics including **Accuracy**, **Recall**, **MAE**, and **R²**.  
- Identified key predictors such as **heredity**, **stress level**, **smoking habits**, and **age**, providing insights for personalized wellness prediction.

### Skills Demonstrated
`Python` · `Pandas` · `NumPy` · `Scikit-learn` · `Matplotlib` · `Feature Engineering` · `Model Evaluation` · `Health Data Analytics`
