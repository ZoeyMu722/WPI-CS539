CS539 â€“ Machine Learning

Key project:
Predicting Baldness Risk and Hair Loss Severity Using Machine Learning â€” applied regression and classification models to analyze a real-world dataset of 7,900 individuals. The project aimed to predict both the probability of developing baldness and the severity of future hair loss based on demographic, genetic, lifestyle, and psychological features.

Highlights:
Built and compared multiple ML models â€” Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Ridge/Lasso Regression, and XGBoost.
Conducted feature engineering (handling missing data, normalization, encoding categorical variables).
Evaluated models via cross-validation with performance metrics including Accuracy, Recall, MAE, and RÂ².
Identified key predictors such as heredity, stress, smoking habits, and age, providing insights for personalized wellness prediction.

Skills: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Health Data Analytics
